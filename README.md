## Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to provide a outline of numpy, focusing on the numpy.random package. 

This assignment will include the following:

- Overall Purpose of the Package

- Explain the use of the "Simple Random Data" & "Permutations" functions

- Explain the use & purpose of at least five "Distributions" functions

- Explain the used of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers

## How to - Run the Notebooks

This NumPy Random overview was completed on a Jupyter Notebook. 

This notebook has been pushed to [github](https://github.com/), from where you can fork from or clone the respository to your [desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop). [2][3] 

Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) you can then run the code on your desktop. [4][5]

Please note you will also need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your device. [6]

If you are on windows you can use [CMDER](https://cmder.net/) as your terminal. [7]

## Nbviewer & Binder

As an alternative to downloading packages to your device, there are two other options to you:

1. [Nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/VCurry20/PDANumpy/blob/main/Numpy.ipynb)

With nbviewer you can view a static image of the notebook. On this page you cannot actively engage with the notebook.

Also, you will see the options along the top right of the viewer, from here you can view the code, view github, download the data and also view the page on Binder.

The following is also a rendering of the nbviewer page - this can be added to documents as a more discrete link option to view the notebook:

2. [Binder](https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/vcurry20-pdanumpy-aeyeyxc2/notebooks/Numpy.ipynb)

This binder link will give you the option to interact with the notebook, you can change the code and therefore outputs. 

Hold Shift and Enter to go down through the notebook - which will also run the code.

As many of the code lines are set as random, the outputs of this code will change each time it is run. This will give you a better overall understanding of the random nature of the data. Further for the data that has been "seeded" you will see that also the data is random it is also reproducible.

The process of using binder to work on the notebook will not save changes or amend the original, it wll however give you a better understanding of the code and the code outputs.
