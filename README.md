This NumPy Random overview was completed on a Jupyter Notebook. 

This notebook has been pushed to github, from where you can fork from or clone the respository to your [desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop). [1][2] 

Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) you can then run the code on your desktop. [3][4]

Please note you will also need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your device. [5]

If you are on windows you can use [CMDER](https://cmder.net/) as your terminal. [6]


## Nbviewer & Binder

As an alternative to downloading packages to your device, there are two other options to you.

[Nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/VCurry20/PDANumpy/blob/main/Numpy.ipynb)

With nbviewer you can view a static image of the notebook - this will
